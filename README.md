This is an enhanced and altered Version of the COre of Engineers Water Quality Integrated Compartment Model (CE-QUAL-ICM)

initially developed by Cerco and Cole (1993).

This model was linked to the Hydrodynamic model FVCOM(Chen et al., 2003; http://fvcom.smast.umassd.edu/) by a group at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and dubbed the Ubstructured Biogeochemical Model (Kim and Khangaonkar, 2012).

The developers of this model are not responsible for any undesired outcomes.

ICM-DOM-PD is intended for research purposes only, and the authors are not responsible for any liability and loss associated with model use.

November 2022 Code has been updated to run with FVCOM4.3 with many code modifications, bug fixes, and additions to run the code efficiently on a supercomputer. THe new code is in the wqmsrc_source_FVM43_Pub directory.
