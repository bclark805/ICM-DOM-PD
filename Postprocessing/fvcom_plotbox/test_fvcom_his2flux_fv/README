 The his2flux.mat store example input control of this flux calculation program:


his2flux =

    fvcom_mat_grid_file: './CHN_HYD.mat'			-matlab format of the fvcom grid file, if you don't have it
									%you can use sms2dm2mat to generate it from the 2dm grid
                his_dir: './netcdf'				-folder storing the netcdf outputs (must have u,v,ww,salinity, w, wt, kh, viscofh)

           hfile_prefix: 'chn'					-case name of the run
              hfile_ext: '.nc'					-extention of the output files (.nc for netcdf)
                 his_Nz: 10					-number of layers in the model
           his_fn_start: 6					-start number of the netcdf file, 1 for chn_0006.nc
             his_fn_end: 7					-end number of the netcdf file used for flux calculation, 7 for chn_0007.nc
    fvcom_medm2txt_exec: 'fvcom_medm2txt'			-- NOT USED
             tracername: 'salinity'				-tracer name, for salinity (i.e. variable name of the tracer in the netcdf files)
              transname: 'cross'				-name of the cross section, any string without space
                     xt: [-44363 -44363]			-start and end x-coordinates of the transect
                     yt: [-539 3379]				-start and end y-coordinates of the transect
            ds_transect: 100					-segment length used to sample the transect (m)
                  t_int: 1					-time index intervals used for subsample the netcdf oututs in time, 2 for very 2 records
             plotoutdir: './cross/'				-folder to store outputs (.plt and .mat files)


How to try this example:

	start xming on windlows
	set up putty to enable X11 forwarding (open putty, go to settings in the SSH-->X11, check X11 forwarding, go to Session and save 

	log on to the linux machine using putty        

	matlab -nodesktop					%run matlab without GUI
	> startup						%execute $HOME/matlab/startup.m to setup various tools used for this program
	> load his2flux.mat
	> his2flux  %this will show all information 
	> %modify his2fux as you wish
	> fvcom_his2flux_fv(his2flux)				%call fvcom_his2flux_fv to calculat the flux (volume, salt, freshwater)
	> 
	>							%results will be in ./cross/ folder with a series of .plt and .mat files
	>							%where 'cross' is the name of thransect in his2flux 


How to try this example to generate a TCE edge line that connects the transects above in xt, yt

	start xming on windlows
	set up putty to enable X11 forwarding (open putty, go to settings in the SSH-->X11, check X11 forwarding, go to Session and save 

	log on to the linux machine using putty        

	matlab -nodesktop					%run matlab without GUI
	> startup						%execute $HOME/matlab/startup.m to setup various tools used for this program
	> load his2flux.mat
	> his2flux  %this will show all information 
	> %modify his2fux as you wish
        > [TCE_edge_line, TCE_edge_element, TCE_edge_ele_edge, TCE_edge_flux_sign]=fvcom_his2flux_fv(his2flux)
	> 
	>							%results will be in ./cross/ folder with a series of .plt and .mat files
	>							%where 'cross' is the name of thransect in his2flux
