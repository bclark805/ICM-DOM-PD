This Repository contains all of the source code, inputs, and postprocessing

to run the FVCOM hydrodynamics and ICM-DOM-PD water quality model for the 

Rhode River, MD, USA contained within the mesohaline region of Chesapeake Bay

for April 1- Nov 30, 2005.

***** This has been tested and run on multiple Linux OS's with 
Intel Parallel Studio 2017 compilers which are complimentary for academic use *****

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

First, the FVCOM model must be run for the entire year (or atleast April 1-Nov 30) to get the forcing to drive

next, the wqm_linkage.in file in the Water_Quality directory can be modified to point to where the FVCOM outputs reside

the offline-coupled ICM-DOM-PD.


1.  Install METIS and netcdf which are both contained in the software directory (directions contained within)

2.  Modify the makefile in the FVCOM source code directory to point towards the METIS and netcdf libraries

3.  compile FVCOM by typing "make clean"  , followed by "make"

4.  Run FVCOM for an entire year, modifying the rhd_run.dat file as desired
	- specify the output directory in the rhd_run.dat file
	- a common command line prompt is: mpiexec -n np executable 
		-where np is the number of processors and executable is the executable generated from building the source code

5.  Use FVCOM to drive the water quality model linking with wqm_linkage.in

	- use a similar command as above changing the executable to the ICM-DOM-PD 

6.  Post-process RhodeFVCOM-ICM model outputs to generate carbon budgets

7.  Enjoy
