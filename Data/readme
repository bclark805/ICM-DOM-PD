This *.mat files contained within this directory are used by

various scripts to compute and process the ICM-DOM-PD model output

to generate a Carbon budget and other results from Clark et al., 

"A comprehensive estuarine carbon budget and the importance of tidal marshes in estuarine biogeochemistry"

The OutputData directory contains 4 sub-directories 

that each have matlab data structures that contain the carbon and nitrogen budget terms

for the Rhode River, MD

in addition, outputs for the difference between the model runs with and without the marsh

are contained in OutputData

The scripts in the Postprocessing directory were primarily used to generate the matlab data structures
