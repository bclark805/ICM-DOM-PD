The parameterizations in this file will be from 

the most recent implementatino of the Chesapeake Bay Program water quality model

detailed by Carl Cerco and Mark Noelle in a report from 2017

the kinetic formulations and algae growth and nutrient partitioning fractions are

the parameters that are changed

parameters related to colred and non-colored carbon are from other sources

this will be for publication

See Clark et al., " A comprehensive estuary organic carbon budget and the impact of tidal wetlands on estuarine biogeochemistry"
